Steps to complete before class!  If you have any questions or issues please send me an email at joshua_beard@aw.org

1: Install VSCode.  The installer can be found at (https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  This software will be used to type the code, and is 
recommended.  If you prefer to use another app for programming, thats okay but make sure it supports python.  

2: Install Python 3.  The installer can be found at (https://www.python.org/downloads/).  Click the big yellow button at the top and follow the steps to 
install.  

3: Download and open hello_world.py (in the main directory of this project).  See if you can figure out how to run it, but we will go over that in class!
