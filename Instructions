1: Install VSCode.  The installer can be found at (https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  This software will be used to type the code, and is

2: Install Python 3.  The installer can be found at (https://www.python.org/downloads/).  Click the big yellow button at the top and follow the steps to 
install.
